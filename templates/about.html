								<h2>I leverage data and processes to transform businesses</h2>																
								<p>Combining my professional experience and academic knowledge in machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and computer Vision, I deliver excellence as a technical thinker and change agent. </p>
								<p>My personal story is a testament of my drive to make transformational changes not just to enhance businesses but also personal lives. Soon after graduation in India, I was fortunate to carry forward my father‚Äôs legacy retail shoe store, which he had built from foundation 40 years ago. After assuming leadership of the business, I further elevated this brand by implementing enhanced style and quality by leveraging my 1 year of experience in Italy. I embarked on a path to implement process automation in recent years to transform a fully localized, manual business to a data and insight generating machine across all facets of the store - accounting, sales, inventory, warehouse etc.  The data insights gave me new lens to work from in measuring our employee performance, strengths, development areas and other metrics.</p>
								<p>While our family business continued to thrive and improve in both brand development and operations, the call to Germany brought us to a crossroad where it would be nearly impossible for me to manage a localized retail store after my move. Personally, I could not bear this burden to see our family legacy decline while I move to take the next steps in my journey. This critical personal pain point put me on the next path to further implement business automation allowing me to oversee our family business remotely while the retail infrastructure continues to live locally. A success story now, technology is the strength that helped elevate my business operations, carved out a path for me to satisfy my life choices, and allowed me to carry my 40-year-old family legacy forward. 	</p>
								<p>My personal experience with data and technology carries me into the next chapter in my life in Germany. Knowing what technology has done for me, I am super passionate about driving positive change in businesses through technology, data and elevating operations. I want to create such resourceful insights for my employers and stakeholders as well while balancing complex technical dependencies for implementation and scalability. While in Germany, I had the opportunity to work with diverse blend of experience and knowledge across teams which has further elevated my professional strengths in teamwork and cross-functional collaboration.</p>
								<p>	I am ready for the next challenge and serving my employer to solve their business problems with my multi-functional professional experience, solid technical acumen and entrepreneurial mindset.</p>

				<h4>üõí How to solve problem for ordering new goods in a fast changing fashion industry?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The complexity that I faced having worked in a retail and an ecommerce business was proper ordering of new products. This becomes even more difficult when dealing multi catalog of products. With fast chaning fashion and new products being launched every day, how could I solve this problem with AI? </li>						
					<li>Currently, I am working on a project to create a dataset of images based on their category. Applying a CNN model to predict the classification of these prodcuts. </li>
					<li>After having found out the maximum sold category from past data, I will pass my model in the new catolog of products and the model will decide which products to be ordered and in what quantity.  </li>

				<h4>üèãÔ∏è How to motivate people to follow fitness routines remotely?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Covid-19 disrupted our lifestyles and work from home made it so difficult for people to contnue their routine lifestyle.</li>						
					<li>The aim of this project is for people to compete on virual platform to motivate them to keep exercising.</li>
					<li>We create datasets of exercise routine and created their skeleton image with Open CV. Then we perform the count predictor to predict the counts done.</li>
					<li>The final aim of this project is to run the model on virtual platforms like Zoom or google meet so multiple people can do the exercise simultaneously and track their performances and also compete with each other</li>

				<h4>ü§ñ How to ease hiring process for both the  HR and the candidate?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Often when thinking of changing a career or a job, the biggest challenge for a candidate is getting back into the job market and start answering the most frequent question that can be asked by the new interviewer.</li>						
					<li>The idea is to constantly train a chatbot through out the professional career by answering questions asked by the chatbot.</li>
					<li>This chat bot will keep on training and after a few questions the chatbot is intelligent to answer the questions related to the professional life of a person.</li>
					<li>Along with portfolio, cv and a cover letter a candidate can also share this chatbot and the chatbot will answer questions to the HR and get you hired. </li>
